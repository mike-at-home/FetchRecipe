# Focus Areas

Most of the time was spent coming up with a reasonably nice UX for such as simple app.


# Time Spent

Approximately 4 to 8 hours - DISCOUNTING UI/UX tweaking.

Basic prototype was roughly an hour - model, basic cache, and so forth.


# Trade-offs and Decisions

Trade-offs due to lack of contextual specificity and scope. 

Normally, I'd do more model translations, and more of a "backend".

Decided not to use smaller images - could be an enhancement.


# Weakest Part of the Project

 Some of the structure of the views; LoadingView, Swift files with multiple definitions.
 
 In retrospect, the LoadingView ought to be separate for the list and the images.
